# Queue
A queue structure that stores elements in a first in/first out fashion represented in in both C and C++

Each one of these three folders contains a different representation of a queue structure.

- queue_class_cpp takes advantage of the pre-existing queue library in C++

- circ_queue & queue have very similar logic but display data in distinct ways
